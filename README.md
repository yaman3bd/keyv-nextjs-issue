**Describe the bug**
I want to use `keyv` in my nextjs middleware to store/access some values from my app cache, I have set everything up
as it was explained here: https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/issues/1065
it is working fine for all my server pages, except it throws an error when I import `keyv` in the middleware. 
the error only shows when I import `keyv` in the middleware or in a file I import it to use it in my middleware for example, import `keyv` in a helper file and import any helper func in the middleware it shows the same error
the error:
